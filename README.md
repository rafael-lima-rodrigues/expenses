# Flutter Project - Expenses


## About
This application is the result of my studies in Flutter. The focus of this project is to explore the different features of Flutter. All the development is based on the course ["Aprenda Flutter e Desenvolva Apps Para Android e IOS 2022"](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-flutter/).
The idea of the course is to create an app for weekly financial spending control, displaying a list with the expenses and a chart representing the amount of spending per day in relation to the total spending of the week.
